üéÆ Group 6 ‚Äì Unity & Blender Experiments

This repository contains a collection of interactive simulations, visual effects, and game development experiments created in Unity and Blender by Group 6. The projects showcase particle systems, physics simulations, motion tracking, and environment effects as part of our academic and personal development work.

Projects Overview
1Ô∏è‚É£ Blender Experiments

Rigid & Semi-Rigid Debris

Simulated falling debris using Rigid Body and Soft Body physics.

Semi-rigid pieces wobble upon collision for realism.

Motion Tracking

Tracked camera movement in live footage.

Integrated virtual 3D objects into real-world scenes.

Particle Simulations

nParticle swarms and bubble masses using Python scripts.

Customizable behavior with velocity expressions and target-based attraction.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Unity Experiments

nParticle Swarms and Bubble Masses

Swarming particles move toward a target.

Bubble masses simulate buoyancy and size variation.

Adding Foliage, Fire, and Smoke with Paint Effects

Painted trees, grass, and terrain details for immersive environments.

Particle systems for dynamic fire and smoke effects.

Key Features Across Projects

Realistic physics simulations using Blender Rigid/Soft Body systems.

Interactive particle systems in Unity with expressions and scripts.
