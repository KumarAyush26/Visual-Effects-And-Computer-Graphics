üéÆ Group 6 ‚Äì Unity & Blender Experiments

This repository contains a collection of interactive simulations, visual effects, and game development experiments created in Unity and Blender by Group 6. The projects showcase particle systems, physics simulations, motion tracking, and environment effects as part of our academic and personal development work.
