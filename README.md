# Visual-Effects-And-Computer-Graphics

üéÆ Group 6 ‚Äì Unity & Blender Experiments

This repository showcases the Visual Effects (VFX) and Computer Graphics experiments I have completed as part of my learning journey in Unity and Blender.
Each experiment explores different techniques for creating realistic simulations, dynamic particles, and immersive visual effects.

üî• Experiment Details
6Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Foliage, Fire, and Smoke with Paint Effects (Unity)

In this experiment, I used Unity‚Äôs Paint Effects tools to create a dynamic scene with foliage, fire, and smoke.

Foliage: Painted grass, trees, and shrubs across the terrain using paint effects.

Fire & Smoke: Integrated particle systems to simulate burning fire and realistic smoke plumes.

Outcome: A rich, interactive environment with natural vegetation and live fire effects.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Water, Smoke, and Sparks with nParticles (Unity)

This experiment focused on simulating fluid and particle dynamics using Unity‚Äôs nParticles.

Created realistic flowing water using particle emitters and shaders.

Designed smoke trails and spark bursts to replicate natural motion.

Controlled particle lifetime, speed, and collision for believable effects.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Generating nParticle Swarms and Bubble Masses with Expressions (Unity)

This experiment explored custom particle behavior using expressions.

Built swarming nParticles that move collectively like a school of fish or flock of birds.

Added bubble masses with rising, floating motion using dynamic expressions.

Tweaked velocity, randomness, and clustering to achieve organic movement.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Simulating Semi-Rigid and Rigid Debris with Python (Blender)

This experiment used Blender‚Äôs physics engine with Python scripting to simulate debris.

Created objects with rigid body physics to simulate breaking and shattering.

Used semi-rigid constraints for partially flexible debris.

Automated debris generation and motion using Python for precise control.

üîü Motion Tracking with MatchMover (Blender)

This experiment involved camera motion tracking to integrate 3D elements into real-world footage.

Used MatchMover (integrated with Blender) to track camera motion from live video.

Placed 3D objects seamlessly in the tracked scene.

Adjusted camera parameters and keyframes for a stable match.
