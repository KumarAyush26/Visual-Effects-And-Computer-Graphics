ðŸŽ¥ Motion Tracking in Blender

This project demonstrates camera motion tracking (match-moving) in Blender to integrate 3D objects into real-world footage.

Workflow Overview

1. Import Footage

   Open the Motion Tracking workspace and load the recorded video in the Movie Clip Editor.

   Set the frame range and camera/lens parameters (focal length, sensor size).

2. Add and Track Markers
 
   Place tracking markers on high-contrast features (corners, patterns).

   Track them forward and backward through the entire clip, adjusting the pattern and search areas to maintain stable tracks.

3. Solve Camera Motion

   Use the Solve panel to calculate the 3D camera movement.

   Refine lens distortion and remove bad tracks until the solve error is acceptably low (ideally < 1 px).

4. Set Up the 3D Scene

    Click Setup Tracking Scene to create a virtual camera and reference plane that match the real camera motion.

    Define ground orientation using three-point or floor constraints.

5. Add 3D Objects

   Insert cubes, text, or other models in the 3D Viewport.

   Because the camera is solved, these objects stay locked to the filmed environment.

6. Composite and Render

   Enable the background movie clip for live preview.

   Use the Compositor to blend the rendered 3D elements with the original video.

Render the final sequence to produce a seamless composite.

Result

The final output shows 3D elements correctly anchored to the live-action footage, moving naturally with the tracked camera.
